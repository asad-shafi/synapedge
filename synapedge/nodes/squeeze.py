    Generates C code for the ONNX Squeeze node, which removes dimensions of size 1.
    Like Unsqueeze, Squeeze only changes the shape, not the data layout â€” so the
    generated C is a simple element-wise copy. This function updates `tensor_shape`
    for downstream nodes and emits a C wrapper that copies the input buffer to the
    output buffer.
